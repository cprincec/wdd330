    <h1>Notes on Events</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>The click events also works when user press the Enter key, taps the screen.</li>
        <li>inline event handlers should be avoided. It goes against the principle of unobtrusive javascript.</li>
        <li>addEVentLister () is the current and best way to add event handlers to a page.</li>
        <li>an events object gets passed to the event handler anytime it is triggered.</li>
        <li>the events object contains information about the event that was triggered.</li>
        <li>The event.type tells the type of event. Eg: "click"</li>
        <li>the event.target tell the element that triggered the event.</li>
        <li>list of all events are found at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events</li>
        <li>Be cautious when using the "click" and "dblclick" events on the same target as the first click of a double
            click will behave as a click event.</li>
        <li>The key press events is the most reliable way to find which character was pressed as it works on only keys
            that produce a character along with the "Delete Key"</li>
        <li>Modifier keys refer to keys such as Ctrl, Shift, Alt, meta (Cmd on Mac)</li>
        <li>Modifires keys will trigger the keydown and keyup events but will not fire the keypress event.</li>
        <li>Event delegation is when an event listener is added to a parent element to capture events that happen to its
            children elements.</li>
    </ul>
