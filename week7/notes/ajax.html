    <h1>AJAX</h1>
    <p>This is the way of sending and/or receiving data from various sources without interferring with other processes
        in our program.
        AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML</p>

    <br>
    <p>The Fetch API is used to implement Ajax </p>

    <h3>HTTP verbs</h3>
    <p>The five most commonly used verbs when dealing with resources on the web are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>GET requests to retrieve resources</li>

        <li>POST requests, usually used to create a resource but can actually perform any task</li>

        <li>PUT requests to upsert, which means insert a resource or update it entirely</li>

        <li>PATCH requests to make partial updates to a resource</li>

        <li>DELETE requests to delete a resources.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By default, a link in a web page will make a GET request. Forms are also submitted using a GET request by
        default, but they will often use a POST request.
        headers
        <br>
        HTTP headers are used to pass on any additional information about a request or response. Typical information
        contained in headers includes the file-type of the resource, cookie information,
        authentication information and when the resource was last modified.
