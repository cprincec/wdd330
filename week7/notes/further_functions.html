    <h1>Further Functions</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>The difference between the call and apply function is that the arguments for an apply method is provided as
            an array.</li>
        <li>you can add properties to functions eg assuming we have a functions called square, we can add a description
            to it thus: square.description = "string that describes the function".
        </li>
        <li>a technique called init branching is used to apply feature detection in a program. To do this, we use a
            function that defines and rewrites itself with two if statement that redefines the function based on if the
            feature is supported or not.
            Example:
            function ride(){
            if (window.unicorn) {
            ride = function(){
            // some code that uses the brand new and sparkly unicorn methods
            return 'Riding on a unicorn is the best!';
            }
            } else {
            ride = function(){
            // some code that uses the older pony methods
            return 'Riding on a pony is still pretty good';
            }
            }
            return ride();
            }</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Recursive function</h2>
    <p>a function that invokes itself continously until a certain condition is met.</p>
    <br>
    <p>- JavaScript is single-threaded which means only one code can run at a time.</p>

    <p> - functions can also return functions</p>

    <p>- Any property delared in a function that defines and rewrites itself is lost after first call.</p>

    <h2> Memoization</h2>
    <p>storing the result of a function in cache so as to retrieve it if the functions is called again with the same
        argument instead of executing the function again.</p>

    <h2>closure</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A closure is formed when a function returns another function that then maintains access to any variables
            created in
            the original functionâ€™s scope</li>
        <li> Closures not only have access to variables declared in a parent function's scope, they can also change the
            value of
            these variables.</li>
    </ul>

    <p> - <em>JavaScript is a multi-paradigm programming language (meaning that it supports functional programming,
            procedural
            programming, object oriented programming etc)</em></p>

    <h2>Higher-Order Functions</h2>

    <p>Higher-order functions are functions that accept another function as an argument, or return another function as a
    result, or both.</p>
