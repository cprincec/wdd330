    <h1>Master Mobile UX</h1>
    <p><strong>This section contains my notes from Master UX lecture</strong></p>
    <h2>Important Principles</h2>
    <h3>Rewiring the brain for mobile first</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The use of mobile devices in accessing the internet has skyrocketted over the years.
            and calls for focus in making sure mobile users have a good experience with the site to encourage
            site traffic. This increase in mobile usage highlights the need/importance of mobile-first approach to 
            web development.
        </li>
        <li>
            Reponsive retrofitting: Taking what you have and making it work on mobile. Compressing site content initially developed
            for desktop to fit into phone screens.
        </li>
        <li>There are more upsides to mobile-first than downsides.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Understanding Users</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Its important to know users so you can best get a feel of what they want.  "....a lot of times, people don't know what they want until you show it to them." Steve jobs.</li>
        <li>provide users with what they want as soon as possible. Make interactions smooth and seamless.</li>
        <li>Make key items within easy click range.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Primary controls</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Primary control buttons eg Menu button; should be placed at easily reachable area such as the bottom of the screen.</li>
        <li>Make primary control icons explicit ie easily identifiable</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Mobile friendly forms</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Make forms simple. only require needed information in forms.</li>
        <li>Make field (inputs, checkboxes etc) easily clickable by increasing with or padding.</li>
        <li>Allow user to hide password if they need to for easy entry</li>
        <li>Spacing</li>
        <li>Provide user with proper keyboard for the required input. Eg for inputs of phone numbers, show only the 
            numbers keyboard.</li>
        <li>Link phone number so users can easily put call across by a simgle tap instead of copy and paste.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Advertising</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Make research before advertising to understand how users use the device and more.</li>
        <li>Avoid autoplay video, audio, pop-ups</li>
        <li>Avoid distracting ad placements.</li>
        <li>Make ads smaller and simple. Use reveal on click adds.</li>
        <li>Content before ads.</li>
    </ul>
