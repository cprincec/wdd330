    <h1>Object Oriented Programming</h1>
    <ul>
        <li> OOP is the style of programming that allows us create objects with properties and methods that act on the
            properties.</li>
        <li>An instance of a class is created to use it.</li>
        <li>JavaScript didn't have classes before ES6</li>
        <li>The "this" keyword refers to an instance of the class.</li>
        <li>All code in a class is implicitly in strict mode</li>
        <li>An error is thrown when trying to access a class that was created using the class declaration method without
            the "new" keyword" </li>
        <li>Static method are called directly using the class name and not an instance of the class.</li>
        <li>dunder proto is short for "double underscore proto" // __proto__</li>
        <li>never use arrays or objects as a default value in prototype.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><strong>mixins</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This is a way of adding properties and methods of some objects to another object without using inheritance.
        </li>
        <li>mixin is achieved through the use of Object.assign() method.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><strong>Composition over inheritance</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Gorilla Banana is the situation where you need a method from a class but end up inheriting the whole class
            to
            gain access to the particular method.</li>
        <li>The composition over inheritance solves the above problem.</li>
    </ul>
