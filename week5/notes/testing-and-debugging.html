    Testing and debugging
Javascript is loosely typed which means that it can run some code without throwing errors that will stop the code or might just do so quitetly
This is a dangerous functions
The strict mode is used to ensure poor codes or errors are thrown so that they can be fixed to avoid a bigger bug at a latter time.
The 'strick mode' key word are ignored by engines that cannot run them
not using strict mode is called sloppy mode
Errors are caused when something goes wrong in a program. They are usually caused by one of the following:

System error ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.

Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.
User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.

Exception is an error that produces a return value that can be used to deal with the error. eg Reference error raised when calling a non existent variable.
THe recommended way to invoke strict mode is to use a self invoking function with strict mode written inside.

JAvaScript error objects include:aReferenceError, SyntaxError, TypeError, URIError, InternalError, RangeError

TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT

This is the process of writing tests for our code (eg functions) in our program before actually writing the code. 
These test would initially fail because the code they test have not been written

Process for TDD
Wite test that initally fail
Write code for the test to pass
Refactor the code test refactored code
Write more test for new features

The above is usually called "red-green-refactor" cycle of TDD, as failing tests usually show up as red, and tests that pass show as green.

Testing Frameworks
Jest is a TDD framework, created by Facebook, that has gained a lot of popularity recently. It makes it easy to create and run tests by providing helper methods for common test assertions.
