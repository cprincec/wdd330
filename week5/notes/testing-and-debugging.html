    <h1>Testing and Debugging</h1>

    <ul>
        <li> Javascript is loosely typed which means that it can run some code without throwing errors that will stop
            the code or might just do so quitetly
        </li>
        <li>This is a dangerous functions</li>
        <li>The strict mode is used to ensure poor codes or errors are thrown so that they can be fixed to avoid a
            bigger bug at a latter time.
        </li>
        <li>The 'strict mode' key word are ignored by engines that cannot run them</li>

        <li>
            Errors are caused when something goes wrong in a program. They are usually caused by one of the following:
            <br>
            <strong>System error </strong>― there’s a problem with the system or external devices with which the program
            is interacting.

            <br> <strong>Programmer error</strong> ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could
            even be as simple as a typo.
            <br> <strong>User error</strong> ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to
            handle.
        </li>

        <li>Exception is an error that produces a return value that can be used to deal with the error. eg Reference
            error raised when calling a non existent variable.
        </li>
        <li>THe recommended way to invoke strict mode is to use a self invoking function with strict mode written
            inside.</li>

        <li>JAvaScript error objects include:aReferenceError, SyntaxError, TypeError, URIError, InternalError,
            RangeError
        </li>

    </ul>
    <h2>TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT</h2>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>This is the process of writing tests for our code (eg functions) in our program before actually writing the
            code.</li>
        <li>These test would initially fail because the code they test have not been written</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <strong>Process for TDD</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Wite test that initally fail</li>
        <li>Write code for the test to pass</li>
        <li>Refactor the code test refactored code</li>
        <li>Write more test for new features</li>
    </ul>

    <em>The above is usually called "red-green-refactor" cycle of TDD, as failing tests usually show up as red, and
        tests that pass show as green.
    </em>
    <h2>Testing Frameworks</h2>
    <p>Jest is a TDD framework, created by Facebook, that has gained a lot of popularity recently. It makes it easy to
        create and run tests by providing helper methods for common test assertions.</p>
