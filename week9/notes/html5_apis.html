    <h1>HTML5 APIs</h1>
    <ul>
        <li> web storage API methods include the localStorage and sessionStorage Methods
        </li>
        <li>the getCurrentPosition method which returns an object containing information about the device takes in one
            arguement which is a callback function.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Web Workers</h2>
    <p>Web workers allow computationally complex operations to be performed in a separate thread, meaning that the flow
        of a program won’t suffer interruptions, and an application will not freeze or hang. They are a useful feature
        that help to keep sites responsive, even when complicated operations are being carried out.
    </p>
    <h2>Service Workers
    </h2>
    <p>The Service Worker API allows a worker script to run in the background with the added benefit of being able to
        intercept network requests. This allows you to take alternative action if the network is offline, and
        effectively create app-like offline experiences. Service workers also allow access to push notifications and
        background syncing. Service workers require a secure network to run on HTTPS to avoid any malicious code
        hijacking network requests.
    </p>
    <h2>Websocket
    </h2>
    <p>Websocket is a new protocol that allows two-way communication with a server – also known as push messaging. This
        means that a connection is kept open and responses are ‘pushed’ to the client as soon as they are received.
