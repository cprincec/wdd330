  <h2>Programming Basics</h2>
  <p>program is an instruction that tells the computer how to perform a particular task.</p>

  <h2> Low-level language</h2>
  <p>Early programs were written in machine code and assembly language. Closer to computer's hardware and as such fast
    execution.</p>

  <h2>High-level language</h2>
  <p>Human readable and writable code. Such as C,C++ or Java. Compiled into machine code and executed.</p>

  <h2>Scripting language</h2>
  <p>These are programming languages that are interpreted at run-time. these languages are not comiled before execution,
    instead, they are interpreted at the moment of execution. This means they are slower execution time that compiled
    languages.</p>

  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Created to add interection with users in webpages.</li>
    <li>Created by Brendan Eich employee of the Netscape company.</li>
    <li>Prototype was created in 10 days (with a lot of bugs and quirks)</li>
    <li> Initially calle Mocha</li>
    <li>then changed to LiveScript</li>
    <li>Named JavaScript to feed off the popularity of JAVA at the time.</li>
    <li>JavaScript's official name is ECMAScript.</li>
    <li>Was widely accepted and used.</li>
    <li>Became misused by rigorous and passive copying and pasting of code snippet that led to use errornous examples
      online.</li>
    <li>Is widely supported among browsers.</li>
    <li>Was standardized with the help of World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and ECMA.</li>
    <li>Javascript Speed has increased over time.</li>
  </ul>





  <strong><em>Don't mix JavaScript with HTML. Seperate them to avoid breaking code after changes to HTML.</em></strong>

  <h3>Unobtrusive JavaScript</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>This approach allow Webpages to function optimally with little or no JavaScript availability.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Principles</strong> <br>
    Seperate JavaScript code from HTML by:
  <ol>
    <li> Using the Script tag</li>
    <li>Using the script tag with src to link to external javasrcipt file.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Graceful Degradation </h3>
  <p>The process of building a website to function well in browsers that supports JavaScript, but still works to a
    reasonable standard in older browser or if JavaScript or some of its features are unavailable.</p>

  <h3>Progressive Enhancement </h3>
  <p>This has to do with building applications that can run with basic functionalities and effects that can run in older
    browsers or less JavaScript availability, then adding functionalities that can run on updated or modern browsers.
  </p>


  <br>

  <h2>CODES</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Math.random() method returns a random number between 0 and 1. It is normally used with the Math.floor() method.
    </li>
    <li>The Math.random() method gives a decimal number, the Math.floor() method rounds down that number. <br>
      Example: return a random number beween 0 and 7 - <br>
      function getRandomInt() {
      return Math.floor(7*Math.random())
      };</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Transpilers</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Converts javascript code from one version to another.</li>
    <li>Babel is a transpiler.</li>
    <li>Babel code to be added to HTML :<\script src='https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6/babel.min.js'>
        <\sscript>
    </li>
    <li>The link must be added before any JavScript tag</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>PROGRAMMING BASICS </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The syntax used by Javascript is known as C-style syntax because its similarities withe the C programming
      language. </li>
    <li>Javascript has 7 data types, six of them are primitive</li>
    <li>Primitive data types include: String, Symbol (introduced in ES6), Number, Boolen, Undefined, Null.</li>
    <li>Any value that isn't one of the primitive data types listed above is an object.</li>
    <li>JavaScript objects includes: arrays, functions and object literals.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3> Variables </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>A variable contains a value stored at memory</li>
    <li>let and const are used to declare variables</li>
    <li>variables have to be declared before they can be used.</li>
    <li>Variables declared with the let and const variables have block scope.</li>
    <li>Variables declared with var keyword are global scope and can be reassigned.</li>
    <li>Variables declared outside curly braces are Global scoped</li>
    <li>Global scope means they can be accessed from anywhere in the program.</li>
    <li>Variables declared within curly braces (blocks) are local scoped which means they can only be accessed within
      that
      block.</li>
    <li>Global variables should be avoided as much as possible</li>
    <li>They can cause name clashes in large programs and bring bugs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3> Variable Naming</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Variable and constants names can begin with any of the following: <br>
      lower or uppercase <br>
      dollar sign ($) - discouraged as JQuery uses same nominal rule <br>
      underscore (_) - This is used to idenfy private properties</li>
    <li>Variables can contain numbers, but cannot start with them.</li>
    <li>Variable names are case sensitive eg: name is not the same as Name and NAME</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Direct Assignment and Assignment by Reference. </h3>
  <ul>
    <li> Assigning a primitive value is know as Direct Assignment</li>
    <li>When a primitive value is stored in a variable, any changes made are made directly to the value.
      <br> Eg: let a = 1; // a = 1
      <br> let b = a; // b = 1, a = 1
      <br> b = 2; // b = 2, a = 1.
      <br> Notice that the change in made to b did not affect the reference a but rather the value.
    </li>
    <li>Assignment by Reference is when a variable stores a non-primitive value.</li>
    <li>In assignment by reference, changes made will affect all references to that object. <br>
      Eg: let a = {value: 1}; <br>
      let b = a; // a.value = 1, b.value = 1 <br>
      b.value = 2; // a.value = 2, b.value = 2</li>
  </ul>


  <h3>Strings </h3>

  <ul>
    <li>JavaScript strings have properties and methods</li>
    <li>Example of property is the .length which returns the number of characters in the string.</li>
    <li>Example of method is the toUpperCase() method which converts a lowercase string to uppercase. The charAt()
      method is
      use to identify the character at a certain position.</li>
    <li>The indexOf() method identifies where a certain character appears in a string. If a character does not appear in
      a
      string, -1 will be returned</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>IMPORTANT STRING METHODS</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>toUpperCase(): changes a string to uppercase</li>
    <li>indexOf(): returns the index of a character in a string.</li>
    <li>charAt(): returns the character at a specific index in a string</li>
    <li>lastIndexOf(): returns the index of the last occurence of a character in a string.</li>
    <li>endsWith(): checks if a string ends with a specific character</li>
    <li>startsWith(): check if a string starts with a character.</li>
    <li>includes(): checks if s string contains a character.</li>
    <li>trim(): removes leading an trailing whitespaces in strings. Including tabs, new line (\n).</li>
    <li>repeat(): repeats a string a stated amount of time.</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>TEMPLATE LITERALS</h2>
  <p>The backtick is used todeliminate strings to allow using of both types of quotes in the same string, interoplation
    of
    Javascript expression in a string.</p>

  <u> QUESTION?</u>
  <em>HOW ARE HEXADECIMAL NUMBER CONVERTED TO DECIMAL?</em>

  <h3>Type Coersion</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>A situation where JavaScript tries to convert a value to another data type inorder to perform an operation on
      it. This
      isdone automatically/implicitly by Javascript.</li>
    <li>Automatic type coersion happens in situation like trying to add number of string type (eg "3") to a number of
      number
      type, thus: <br>
      "3" * 2 = // will return 6 even though 6 is a string. Javascript coerced the "3" into a number type to enable the
      multiplication <br>
      Manual type conversion can be done using: <br>
      1. String() - for converting numbers to string. <br>
      2. Number() - for converting numbers to string. <br>
      etc. </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Parsing Numbers</h3>
  <ul>
  <li> This is converting numbers represented as string (such as "2", "78") to number. Eg: <br>
  let num = "2" <br>
  parseInt(num) // returns 2 </li>
  <li>Using the parseInt() on decimal numbers of string type returns just the numbers before the decimal point. <br> Eg:
  parseInt("2.9") // returns 2.</li>
  <li>parseFloat() is used to return a decimal number of string type as a float number data type.</li>
</ul>

<h2>BOOLEAN </h2>
<ul>
 <li>Every value in JavaScript has a Boolean value and most of them are true (known as truthy value)</li> 
 <li>There are 9 values that are known as falsy values, namly: "", '', ``, 0, -0, NaN, false, null, undefined.</li> 
</ul>
 <strong>Do not use the ^ operator for exponent. Use the specific math method: math.pow()</strong>
